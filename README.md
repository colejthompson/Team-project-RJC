==Text Hero==

Text Hero is a text based game where players choose between good and evil while trying to survive. 
If the player chooses to put out a burning building, he or she gains good points. 
If the player chooses to catch the man who started the fire for his bounty,
he or she gains evil points. When the player reaches the end of the game and has lived through all the dangers, 
they win and find out if they're truly hero or villain.Team-project-RJC
